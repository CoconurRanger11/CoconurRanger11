Hey peeps! 👋


I’m Arif, a Software Engineering student who loves designing clean and user-friendly websites.

I focus a lot on UI/UX design using Figma, turning ideas into structured, modern, and interactive web experiences. I enjoy designing systems that are simple, aesthetic, and easy to use.

This profile is where I share my design projects, experiments, and website concepts.
